# GET BOOSTED

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### 'yarn dev'

For quick dev purposes

### 'yarn run build'

For building up the app (we had problems before - some items worked in dev but not prod so be sure to build and run the next command)

### 'yarn run start'

Boot up the app after building
